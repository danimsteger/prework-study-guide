# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created to provide an easy-to-read prework study guide for students enrolled in an upcoming coding bootcamp.  Additionally, the project served as a practical application of the concepts and skills that we taught during prework.  Creating this project helped me to learn and apply the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

To see JavaScript in action, open the DevTools console in your browser by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows).  The console will display a list of topics covered in the guide and randomly select one for you to study first, providing an interactive way to reinforce your learning.
